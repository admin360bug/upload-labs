### What is ShowDoc ?

Whenever we take over a module or project which has been developed by other people, we always feel crazy watching at those codes without notes. Where is the document?! Where is the document?! **Show me the doc !!**

A programmer often hopes the others to write technical documents, with the hope of not writing them on his/her own. Because writing a technical document needs a lot of time to handle the format and layout, and the person who writes it has to think of all kinds of non-technical details such as which catalog to put in the newly-established word document

All kinds of the word documents are kept by different persons in a team dispersedly. The person who needs other documents gets the documents by shouting out. He/She gives a shout asking for the documents and then receives them from other people by IMs or the e-mail. This kind of communication is not bad, but the efficiency is not high.

ShowDoc is a tool greatly applicable for an IT team to share documents online. It can promote communication efficiency among members of the team.
